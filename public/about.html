<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  “We wanderers, ever seeking the lonelier way, begin no day where we have ended another day; and no sunrise finds us where sunset left us.
   Even while the earth sleeps we travel. We are the seeds of the tenacious plant, and it is in our ripeness and our fullness of heart that we
    are given to the wind and are scattered.”
  ― Kahlil Gibran</p>

<p>
  “You have been told that, even like a chain, you are as weak as your weakest link.
  This is but half the truth.
  You are also as strong as your strongest link.
  To measure you by your smallest deed is to reckon the power of the ocean
  by the frailty of its foam.
  To judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inconstancy.”
  ― Kahlil Gibran</p>

<p>
  “You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts;
  And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime.
  And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered.”
  ― Khalil Gibran.</p>


  <p>Sometimes, we're inspired by a quote that we didn't even know came from a book. I've heard "Not all those who wander are lost" 
    countless times but never knew it was from a beloved fantasy series. To create this list, I looked at some of the most memorable 
    and moving quotes from literature throughout time. For readers looking for a new inspirational read or wondering where some of the
     greatest lines originated from, here are some of the best literary quotes and the books they came from.</p>


     <p>"Too much sanity may be madness — and maddest of all: to see life as it is, and not as it should be!"
      -"Don Quixote" by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra</p>
